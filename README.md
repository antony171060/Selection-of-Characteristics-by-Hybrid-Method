### Selection of Characteristics by Hybrid Method: RFE, Ridge, Lasso, and Bayesian for the Power Forecast for a Photovoltaic System

Abstract: Currently, the generation of alternative energy from solar radiation with photovoltaic systems is growing, its efficiency depends on internal variables such as powers, voltages, currents; as well as external variables such as temperatures, irradiance, and load. To maximize performance, this research focused on the application of regularization techniques in a multiparametric linear regression model to predict the active power levels of a photovoltaic system from 14 variables that model the system under study. These variables affect the prediction to some degree, but some of them do not have so much preponderance in the final forecast, so it is convenient to eliminate them so that the processing cost and time are reduced. For this, we propose a hybrid selection method: first we apply the elimination of Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) within the selection of subsets and then to the obtained results we apply the following contraction regularization methods: Lasso, Ridge and Bayesian Ridge; then the results were validated demonstrating linearity, normality of the error terms, without autocorrelation and homoscedasticity. All four prediction models had an accuracy greater than 99.97%. Training time was reduced by 71% and 36% for RFE-Ridge and RFE-OLS respectively. The variables eliminated with RFE were “Energia total”, “Energia diaria” e “Irradiancia”, while the variable eliminated by Lasso was: “Frequencia". In all cases we see that the root mean square errors were reduced for RFE.Lasso by 0.15% while for RFE-Bayesian Ridge by 0.06%.
